@ervinchua2 As discussed in slack earlier on

Each error message has a name
You can call them by eg error['username']
The name of the error would be the same as the name of the input field
Hope this helps in solving inability to use for each loop

At the moment, the error messages still appear at the bottom, but the task is marked as completed?

Grace Zheng on Build UI for login/registration page
Hi Ervin, as I'm implementing registration, may I request some changes to the signup form?

as our CUSTOMERS database is as followed:

id (primary key)
customer_name
username
password
mobile_phone
email_address
address
We might need to replace ZIP with email_address.

Also, do you think if it'd be a good idea to have password confirmation (so user has to enter the same password again to prevent mistakes)?

**Instead of the last one
- When an existing user accidentally types in wrong its username, system should return a username does not exist exception.
- When an existing user accidentally types in wrong its password, system should return an incorrect password exception.

**Should we also consider this?
- When an existing user forgets its password, system should allow reset it through its email account.
